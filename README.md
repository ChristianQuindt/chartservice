# chartservice

This project contains a framework to load metrics from third-party-providers REST-API and visualize them in the vaadin-charts framework.
Additionaly, a microservice can be used inbetween the framework and the provider to optimise requests, for example to not exceed the providers rate-limit.
This project is the practical part of my bachelor thesis.
